This is Maily, my submission for CS50W2020 project 3, Mail.

Maily is a front-end email client where uses can create account, send emails, reply to emails, and archive or unarchive emails.
All mails are stored inside the project database (they won't be sent to real email servers).
Mails are sent, recieved and updated using the application API.
